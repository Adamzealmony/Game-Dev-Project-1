MAIN MENU:
Recently some mutant fast growing grass was discovered in a local farmer's field. You've been sent to do some initial scouting and cleanup of this invasive grass.
Left unchecked, this grass could grow over an entire town in a matter of days. Luckily, once it's cut down to the ground, it doesn't seem to grow back.

Your mission is to clear out as much grass as possible before the second team arrives.

END LEVEL 1:
As the second team arrives, you get reports of more grass growing in a nearby forest. You decide to investigate this new area while the second team finishes up here.

BEAT GAME:
As you take a moment to wipe the sweat off your brow, you see the second team emerge into the clearing.
They give you a pat on the back and send you back to base as they finish what you started.
